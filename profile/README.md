## The GeneGenie project

This organisation is a collection of tools and utilities to manage family history data. 
The goal is for you to own your own data and host it yourself without needing to pay a subscription.

It is a work in progress so until things are a bit more stable, releases will not be made (although
you can always build your own releases).

Contact me on Mastodon at @ryanoneill1970@mastodon.social if you'd like to discuss this work.

The current effort is to update all projects to the latest version of .Net and make all builds reliable.
